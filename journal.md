I think the new texas law is good and bad at the same time.
Some kids may want to contact parents,guardians or access some information only accessable on their phones.
for example I wanted to check my password for my judson isd because i couldnt remember it and i could because of the law
in another example my friend wanted to show me a picture of something during lunch but couldnt because of the law
this is also good because it makes kids focus in class.
